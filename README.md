This project is a dynamic food recipe website developed using HTML and CSS. It features a collection of diverse and delicious recipes, each presented with vibrant images and easy-to-follow instructions. The site includes a user-friendly contact form, allowing visitors to reach out with questions, feedback, or their own recipe suggestions. This project showcases my front-end development skills, focusing on clean, responsive design and an engaging user experience.
